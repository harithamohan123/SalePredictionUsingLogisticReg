# Advertisement Sale Prediction Using Logistic Regression Classifier 
______________________________________________________________________
         
  Advertisement sale prediction from existing customer dataset. We are predicting the customer buying purchase status baesd on collected datase.                   
  
  Procedure :                                                                                                                    
        => Analyse the problem that is need to be found.                                                                         
        => Collect dataset with input as age and salary . We assume the output as Purchase status.                                                    
        => Load dataset and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns.                                                                    
        => Using iloc segregate the independant and dependant values. (iloc - helps to select values belonging to particular row and column)         
        => Split train and test set for validation.                                                                                               
        => We do feature scaling to scale our data to make all features contribute equally to result.                                          
        => Use Logistic regression algorithm.                                                                                          
        => Training model for preprocessing dataset.                                                                            
        => Confusion matix used for validation that gives accuracy with true postive, true negative, false positive, false negative values.                
        => Observe how our model classify our new data.
